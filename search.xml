<p>When I went to the house of my richest friend. I was in elementary school at the time. The boy’s family lived in an <u>enormous</u> <u>mansion</u>. It was grand. It was glorious. Every <u>nook</u> and <u>cranny</u> of that building seemed to <u>exude</u> power, wealth, success. Walking up to the main door, I was utterly <u>in awe of</u> the size of… everything.</p>
<img src="https://gitee.com/zjloved/blogimg/raw/master/img/image-20220209195916504.png" alt="" style="zoom: 80%;" />

<p>Then I went inside. And it was… empty. Not literally empty, there were chairs, sofas, the largest television set I had ever seen and some lamps. But the house had no books. The house had few pictures. And there were no parents to be seen.</p>
<p>I asked were my friends’ father was? At work, the answer went. He was always at work. His mother was “sick”, on bed with a headache.</p>
<p>Every time I was there, and I was there five or six times, dad was away at work, mom was sick with a headache. Looking back I’m almost certain the woman was an alcoholic. The man a workaholic. My friend was raised more or less by his older siblings.</p>
<p><strong>Our house was small. Our families <u>deeply involved</u>. Life was simple… but it felt full. Theirs, though outwardly grand, felt empty. Just visiting that <u>eery</u> house a handful of times reminded me of how good I had it.</strong></p>

<p>My favorite place to live while growing up was with my Grandmother. She had a small barely 1,200 ft <u>farmette</u> w&#x2F;1 bathroom. Many of my aunts and uncles (5 of them) still lived at home and a cousin who was my age also lived with her. The house was crowded, loud and full of love, laughs and great food. It was absolute <u>bliss</u> for me.</p>

<p>I feel you! My own grandparents’ home, too, was a magical place. It was big. But full. So many items, so many photos, so many artifacts, each with their own unique story. There were always people going in and out, neighbors dropping by, uncles visiting, cousins parking the bikes in the drive way and relaxing in the sun in the garden behind their house… a magical place, a grandparents’ home. Don’t know how that works. It somehow just is.</p>

<p>Most people won’t support you until they see it’s popular to support you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When making any major life decision, remember: If it’s not a “Fxck Yes”, then it’s a “No.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not supposed to be the same person you were a year, month, day, or even five seconds ago. You are designed to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most powerful way to win an argument is by asking questions. It can make people see the flaws in their logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Just because you don’t share it on social media, doesn’t mean you’re not up to big things.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Live it and stay <u>low key</u>. Privacy is everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One man’s ‘<u>nah</u> you require too much’ is another man’s ‘that’s all you need?’ Don’t settle. You can find better ones.</p>

<p>May I make a suggestion that will help the environment?</p>
<p>Call the store on the phone and apologize, say that you noticed when you got home that one banana did not get scanned.</p>
<p>Ask if you can pay for that banana the next time you are in the store.</p>
<p>I bet the manager tells you to forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>personal anecdote</strong></p>
<p>One time I was at <u>Piggly Wiggly</u> for one item. After getting the <u>syrup</u>, I realized I didn’t have my wallet. I asked a manager who knew me by name if I could take it and pay for it the next day. He was happy to give me permission.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to a <u>register</u>, asked them to <u>ring me up</u> for the syrup without my having it there. She did. I showed the receipt to <strong>Mr. Rogers</strong>, yes that’s his name, and he smiled.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/S-Hosain-1">S Hosain</a>:<br>
While in college, a friend and I bought a bunch of items at a supermarket to make dinner for about 6 or 7 people. After we left to walk back, I glanced at the bill and realized that it was <em>way</em> too low.</p>
<p>The cashier <em>had</em> scanned everything in front of us - we heard the beeps and tones, etc., but many items just had not made it to the total. As I recall, we had been <em>undercharged</em> about 30% to 40%.</p>
<p>We walked back and spoke to the manager. After he realized that we were not complaining about being <em>over</em>charged or that the cashier was making errors (we were very clear about that!), he went over the register and realized that it wasn’t working properly. I guess many people had paid less than they should have - certainly that day!</p>
<p>He shut the register down, thanked us, and waved us out! As college students with a tight budget, this certainly helped the dinner cost out for all of us!</p>
<p>Honesty is the right approach.</p>

<p>When I was 7, I was diagnosed with Type 1 <u>Diabetes</u>. I was in 2nd grade. My mom decided to get me a flip phone through Tracfone to text her if my blood sugar drops or if the nurse doesn’t show up to give me my <u>insulin</u> dose.</p>
<p>Every other year after that I got a new Tracfone for Christmas. When I turned 12 or 13, I asked my mom for a newer, better phone. I had just moved to the high school (7th-12th grade) and everyone else had nice iPhones. I knew my mom couldn’t afford an iPhone so I searched eBay for any phone that would do more than a cheap Tracfone.</p>
<p>At my school, teachers allow students to use a phone to search things, take pictures of <u>dissections</u> or powerpoints, or do our online assignments. I wanted to be able to be like everyone else and not have to go to get a teacher to unlock the room to the laptops to be able to do what others do or have to use a dictionary and have homework because it took too long to find the definitions.</p>
<p>I found a cheap android phone by the company Blu and my mom bought it for me. I loved it. My mom couldn’t afford data so I used the school’s WiFi.</p>
<p>About 2 years later, I wanted an iPhone. I got bullied for being poor and having a phone that became slow and was considered cheap. My mom got me a <u>refurbished</u> iPhone 6s Plus for Christmas 2016. I’m still using this phone and I love it.</p>
<p>Yes, I’d LOVE to have the newest iPhone but I’m very thankful to have this phone. My family hasn’t had an income for 4 years yet my mom figured out a way to get me a better phone that would last a while.</p>
<p>I’m NOT telling you that this is what you should do. What I’m saying is ask her why she thinks she needs an iPhone. Ask her why she feels that way. Try to compromise with her. But <u>hear her out</u>. Teenagers often feel as if their feelings are invalid and that we don’t have good points.</p>
<p>Have a conversation, don’t yell or raise your voice or have an attitude that screams “I’m better than you and only my points and views are valid”. It makes us more angry because our side of the conversation isn’t being heard.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is listen to her. Everything will work out ❤️</p>

<p>When I was in a dark period I <u>instituted</u> a simple rule that changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>Rule:</strong><br>
<strong>When I arrive home from work, the very first thing I tell my wife is the best thing that happened that day.</strong></p>
<p>No exceptions. No complaining. Just the best thing that day, even if it was just a good cup of coffee. This had the effect of starting our evening off on a positive note and it changed our relationship.</p>

<p>If you mean desert greening (as a result of which the climate inevitably changes to a more <u>humid</u> and less severe one), then yes - they do it, and they have success. The <u>Mu-Us Desert</u> is clear evidence:</p>

China has come a long way in this effort. Back in 1983 in Hong Kong when I was working in an intl bank, I met a foreigner who came down from Gansu, he told me he was involved in desert greening there and we talked about the trees and plants used and some trial and experiments. From then to now it is almost about half a century.</p>

<p>A big, big thank you to my ex for showering me with these beautiful pieces of advice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never date someone you’re not attracted to.</strong> If you’re confused, it’s a <strong>NO.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Never date someone who has recently come out of a break-up.</strong> He/She might be on a rebound. In fact, in most of the cases, they are.</li>
<li><strong>Never date someone who’s not emotionally strong as you.</strong> You’ll be the one to suffer.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t rush things.</strong> Rushing things will only lead to more complications. Start slow. Discover each other.</li>
<li>If your partner has lied to you on small things, he/she is capable of lying to you on more big things as well. Immediately leave them.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of communication destroys a relationship.</strong> Always communicate about your problems with your partner. Try to sort them out.</li>
<li>And lastly, don’t confuse lust with love.</li>
</ul>
<p>Peace</p>

<p><em><strong>Neil Barembaum:</strong></em><br>
I would add two more, just as basic as these. Never date someone who is with someone else, even if they are willing to leave them for you — especially if they leave them for you. If they leave them for you, they will leave you for the next person.<br>
Never date someone because you think it is your last chance. There will always be another.</p>

<p>Let me answer this with my own <u>anecdote</u>.</p>
<p>My wife has had medical problems that have caused her to lose her figure. She is now very thin and wrinkled, and in the past year she’s lost all her teeth. She has <u>dentures</u> but usually won’t wear them when she’s at home.</p>
<p>We’ve been together for just short of 41 years now.</p>
<p>Anyway, one day she was sitting on the couch folding clothes, so I sat down on the couch next to her and gathered her in my arms. That beautiful ( though toothless) smile was still there, as was the light in her eyes that has never dimmed.</p>
<p>And I held her and realized, “my God I will always love this woman”.</p>
<p><strong>And above all, in those eyes I saw that she feels the same about old, <u>arthritic</u> and wrinkled me.</strong></p>

In my basement, I have a small metal lockable box. The kind that is typically used to keep cash in at garage sales.</p>
<p>In that box is a picture of my wife. She was 20 years old and worked in a supermarket. Back then cashiers wore white uniforms, similar to a nurse’s outfit.</p>
<p>Anyhow, she is just standing, smiling, in her white dress. That’s all. No sexy. Just standing, and smiling.</p>
<p>When I look at her now, 50 years later, that’s what I see. I swear, in my eyes she hasn’t changed a bit.</p>
<p>I don’t know how that works, but it does.</p>

I think advises should be followed depending on your situations… What will I do with driving license if I don’t have a car and not going to drive it. I just love driving and cannot imagine a day without my car…:-)</p>

<p>Very common to hear parents say “I love you” in the Chinese culture. BUT, these words must be translated. Here is the Chinese to English translation of<br>
“I love you”:</p>
<p><strong>Words</strong><br>
“Have you eaten today?”<br>
“ate!”<br>
“Eat some more!”<br>
“Have this soup it will build strong blood.”</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong><br>
Mothers will give the best pieces of meat to their children.</p>
<p>Parents whose children are studying at universities will wonder and worry if their children are healthy or coming down with a cold or flu. They will make phone calls to ask their children if they are having enough to eat.</p>
<p>Mothers will receive <u>hand-me-down</u> children’s clothing from friends and relatives and will take them apart and sew them into astonishing clothing that their children will like wearing.</p>
<p>Parents will continue to wear broken down shoes and <u>slippers</u> so their children can have shoes that fit well to wear to school so their feet won’t hurt while studying.</p>
<p>If you tell Chinese parents your friends don’t have enough money to eat they will say, “Bring them home for dinner, I will make good soup for them.” And will place the best pieces of meat on their plates just as they do for their own children.</p>
<p>They will make deep sacrifices to pay for books, school supplies, and tuition so their children will be able to have a safe and flourishing future through education. (Can you see the vision that comes from their heart?)</p>
<p>Parents even express their love openly when introducing their children to people. The tone of their voice says, “I love you” when they say, “He/she is my son/daughter, he/she went to XXX college.” The pride in their voices say, “<strong>I love them so much, they are my life. I live for them.</strong>”</p>
<p>Can you feel their love?</p>

<p><strong>中国父母会轻易说出“我爱你”吗？</strong></p>
<p>在中国文化中，经常听到父母说 “我爱你”，但是这三个字都是藏着这些话里：<br>
“你今天吃饭了吗？”<br>
“吃了！”<br>
“多吃点！”<br>
“多喝这个汤，可以补血”</p>
<p><strong>父母的行为</strong></p>
<p>母亲会把最好的肉片留给孩子吃。</p>
<p>子女在大学读书的父母经常会担心自己的孩子是否健康、是否感冒了，他们会打电话询问孩子在外面是否吃得饱。</p>
<p>妈妈们会收到亲朋好友送来的旧衣服，她们有时候会把这些衣服拆开再缝成孩子们喜欢穿的好看的衣服。</p>
<p>有些家长会继续穿破旧的鞋，好让他们的孩子在学校里能穿一双合脚的鞋子，让孩子在学习的时候脚不疼。</p>
<p>如果你告诉父母，你的朋友没有钱吃饭，他们会说：“带他们回家吃饭吧，我会给他们煲好汤”，并且会把最好的肉块放在他们的盘子里，就像给自己的孩子吃一样。</p>
<p>他们会做出挺大的牺牲来支付书本、学习用品和学费，让他们的孩子能够通过教育拥有一个辉煌的未来。</p>
<p>父母甚至在向人们介绍自己的孩子时会公开表达自己的爱心。当他们说：&quot;他/她是我的儿子/女儿，他/她上了XXX大学 &quot;的时候，他们的语气就是在说“我爱你，我很骄傲”，他们语气中的自豪感是在表达“我很爱他们，他们是我的生命。我为他们而活。”</p>
<p>你能感受到他们的爱吗？</p>

<li>Having big boobs. Now, I know people think it’s a gift but no, really no. They are unnecessary &amp; painful obstructions.</li>
<li>The monthly Niagara falls accompanied by loose motion and weird cramps. Periods are ridiculous.</li>
<li>Childbirth is obviously a shitstorm and there are all kinds of idiocies related to pregnancy that a good engineer could have designed out.</li>
<li>Being seen as a baby factory. It’s my womb, I’ll decide if I want to put it to use.</li>
<li>Not feeling safe. I’d love to just be able to go for a walk alone when it’s dark out but the risks are too high.</li>
<li>Waxing, shaving or threading.</li>
<li>Basically, feeling the constant need to look a certain way due to societal pressure.</li>
<li>Having my looks matter more than my work or talent. Not always, but sometimes.</li>
<li>So many boys who wanna be our “friend” aren’t actually looking for friendship but hoping for something more. It feels kinda shitty.</li>
<li>Not being as naturally physically strong, knowing that any man could easily overpower me.</li>
<li>People assuming that me liking other women just means I’m kinky or want a threesome. Please don’t be so dense. I’m just not straight, thank you.</li>

<p>Next time you have a question for your boss, do the following.</p>
<p><strong>Ask the question, but also answer it as best you can, and give your reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>So, instead of, “Hey Asim, what shall I tell Jake?”</p>
<p>It should be, “Hey Asim, what shall I tell Jake? I suggest we agree to his terms because I feel if we push him any further it’ll just delay things by weeks, possibly months. The last time we made a change it took us 7 weeks to get sign off.”</p>
<p><strong>Look for small ways in which you can add value. And make it a habit.</strong></p>

I honestly wouldn’t want one. Even if I could afford it, which i clearly can’t. Things like this I’ve never understood the need or desire for. As the saying goes, you can put a silk dress, pearls, and lipstick on a pig and it’s still a pig. I value skill and experiences. Such people as drive these sorts of cars enjoy drawing attention to themselves, which I’ve always found rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>She’s super cool!</p>
<p>When I started dating again, I made a list of things I wanted. I didn’t want to fall into the trap that so many guys fall into of just trying to date the hottest possible woman with no regard for other factors. Looks surely matter and she’s beautiful—but she has other things going on too.</p>
<p>She’s an archaeology professor at USF, with a focus on digital archaeology, so she is scanning artifacts and various cool things. She spent years living on excavations in Europe and Turkey (her focus is Bronze Age Archaeology).</p>
<p>Like most people with a Ph.D., she’s super motivated, smart, and fun to talk to.</p>
<p>If you haven’t noticed, I have an eclectic set of interests and consume a lot of information. In the past, I’ve had girlfriends roll their eyes and call me a weirdo when I start talking about goofy niche topics (things I write about here on Quora).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t roll her eyes. Her name is Laura. We collaborate a lot on life and work decisions.</p>
<p>She’s an editor for several academic journals so she’s always great at giving me feedback about my stuff. She’s not afraid to tell me when my writing sucks and needs work. It makes me better at what I do.</p>
<p>I got lucky.</p>

I’m not going to focus on the fact that both of you are good-looking as that’s bloody obvious. Rather, I’d like to zero in on the fact that you found someone who can relate to you and your interests. That to me is far, far, far more valuable than their external beauty. Don’t know why it makes me so happy for you. Wish you good luck, buddy and hope you guys live a long, happy life together 🥂</p>

<p><strong>Just stay busy.</strong></p>
<p>If you are breaking up, stay busy, keep your mind on other things. Staying busy makes the time fly by, and time flying by is the ticket to healing.</p>
<p>If your relationship is 50/50, on the rocks, maybe ending, stay busy, focus on your own life, if you come off as desperate and waiting for his/her attention it doesn’t do you any favors in being more attractive.</p>
<p>If you are single, again, stay busy, get out and do things, that’s how you meet people.</p>
<p>The worst thing you can do is lie around and <u>wallow</u> in your own loneliness and misery. I learned this the hard way.</p>
<p>Stay busy.</p>

<li>Never hope on marrying someone when almost 70% of their family members don’t like you. The probability of the marriage not lasting is very high and you’re probably not going to enjoy the relationship.</li>
<li><strong>There is a distinct difference between dating for love and dating for sex.</strong> Always understand the main reason why you’re <u>venturing</u> into a relationship.</li>

<li>As long as it is still a relationship, never reveal your full potential or secrets to whoever you are dating.</li>
<li>Your personal development should come first before relationships. People who you are in relationships with can still leave you but you can never leave yourself, meaning never compromise your adventures and dreams for anyone.</li>
<li>Avoid relationships that seems to be too good to be true at the beginning. When the other person is rushing things too fast, don’t get carried away with romance and sex. Slow down and be careful because this is how people <u>get hooked on</u> to <u>narcissistic</u> partners.</li>
<li><strong>Never date someone that gives commands and doesn’t respect you.</strong> The probability of emotional abuse is very high.</li>

<li>You see classmates on Facebook you haven’t seen since high school, and you are shocked at the middle age person who inhabited their bodies.</li>
<li>Then you look in the mirror and realize they say that about you, too.</li>
<li>Your mind is as sharp as ever, and you feel like you have learned a few things, too, maybe even a bit of wisdom.</li>
<li>But you feel more aches and pains. You don’t recover from hard work as quickly. I developed <u>inflammatory</u> <u>arthritis</u> at 27 which turned me into an 88 year old, so I suppose my experience may be unique.</li>
<li>You have noticed that women age better than men. And that includes you.</li>
<li>You consider how long it took to get to 45, and if you make it to 90, then you get to redo all you have already experienced—the glass is indeed only half empty.</li>
<li>You are too old to be a sports star, but very young for a politician.</li>
<li>You take care of children while caring for <u>ailing</u> parents. It is a very stressful time. Very stressful. And if your parents are gone, you grieve them. <strong>You even miss the hard times and would like them back because you still were a son or daughter. Now you’re just a parent. Or not.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You no longer can use youth as an excuse for doing dumb shit.</strong> But you are probably not interested in doing crazy shit anymore, either. Why? Because you are 45.</li>

<p><em><strong>Chris Fernandez-Packham:</strong></em><br>
How well people age is down to genetics, diet, lifestyle and presentation. Frankly most men make little too no effort on their appearance and look dreadful when they don’t need to. Often middle aged guys dress badly, neglect skin care and hygiene, and are either lazy or immature. They create their own problems in that regard.</p>
<p>But since most men aren’t as judged on their appearance as women, they aren’t as incentivised. Plus men in manual labour work in harsh conditions that prematurely age them.</p>

<p>One afternoon a long time ago (we must have been around fourteen years old) a friend of mine was talking to his dad.</p>
<p>“I am in love with a girl” he said, “and I’d like to know how to keep her by my side.”</p>
<p>“You can’t” his dad said. “You can’t keep her. The best you can do is give her whatever she lacks.”</p>
<p>“Like, gifts? Like what?”</p>
<p>“No, no” said his dad. “I am not talking about stuff. I am talking about how she feels about her place in her life. Does she go through a lot of uncertainty? Give her stability. Does she feel in any way trapped? Give her freedom. Does she feel she does not matter? Give her the best quality of your attention. Does she feel things are always <u>turbulent</u>? Give her peace.”</p>
<p>I have thought about this advice for decades, and the distinction between “completing” someone and providing a <u>counterpoint</u> in their life.</p>
<p><strong>The most fortunate relationships are a natural match between what a person lacks and what the other cannot wait to give.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>很久以前的一个下午（我们那时候一定是14岁左右），我的一个朋友正在和他的父亲谈话。</p>
<p>他说：“我爱上了一个女孩”，“我想知道如何才能把她留在我身边。”<br>
“你不能”，他爸爸说，“你不能留住她，你能做的最好的事就是给她她所缺少的东西。”<br>
“比如呢？礼物？还是什么？”<br>
“不，不”，他爸爸说，“我不是在谈论物质类的东西，我说的是她对自己在生活中位置的那种感受，比如她是否经历了很多不确定的事情？那么就给她安定。她是否感到被束缚住？那么就给她自由。她是否觉得自己并不重要？那么就多给她些关注。她是否觉得事情总是令她忐忑不安？那么就给她平静。”</p>
<p>几十年来我一直在思考这个建议，以及“让某个人完整”和“在他们的生活中互补”之间的区别。</p>
<p><strong>最幸运的恋爱关系是一个人所缺乏的东西和另一个人迫不及待要给予的东西能够自然匹配上</strong>。</p>

<p><strong>Do not try to be the man your father would want you to be. Be the man you would like your son to be be.</strong> It more clearly defines your own convictions, desires, goals, and motivates you to be your best.</p>

<p>When the children passed an old house on their way home from school, they were always rubbing their sticks on the balcony <u>railing</u> and enjoying the sound. The older owner, who had been bothered by the noise for a long time, had a really good idea instead of scolding the kids.</p>
<p>He called the children over to him: “Children, the noise you make sounds very nice, I’ll give you a pound a day if you keep going like this.” So he gave the kids a pound a day.</p>
<p>In the second week he called the children over again: “Children, my money is scarce, I can only give you fifty pence, not a pound.”</p>
<p>Now three weeks had passed and the old man called the children over to him for the last time: “Children, unfortunately I have no money, so I can’t give you any more.” The children: “No money, no noise” and so they stopped rubbing the sticks on the balcony railing.</p>

<p>当孩子们在放学回家的路上经过一栋老房子时，他们总是用棍子在阳台的栏杆上摩擦，他们很享受这声音。年长的主人被这种声音困扰了很久，后来他想到一个非常好的主意来结束这个事儿，他的方法却不是责骂孩子们。</p>
<p>他把孩子们叫到他身边，“孩子们，你们发出的声音非常好听，如果你们继续这样的话，我每天给你们一英镑”，孩子们孩子继续，于是他每天给孩子们一英镑。</p>
<p>在第二个星期，他又把孩子们叫了过来，说：“孩子们，我的钱不多了，我只能给你们50便士，不能给你们一英镑了。”</p>
<p>现在三个星期过去了，老人最后一次把孩子们叫到他身边，说：“孩子们，不幸的是我现在没钱了，所以我不能再给你们了，谢谢你们给我带来的声音。” 孩子们说：“没钱，就没有声音”，于是他们就再也没在阳台栏杆上摩擦过木棍。</p>

<p>My first job was that of a school teacher, with a salary package of 67$ per month. I worked there for one year, and to my own surprise, I saved my entire salary. Not for one month, but for one whole year.</p>
<p>No exception, every single penny saved, <strong>suppressing all the <u>urges</u> to buy anything for myself for one whole year.</strong></p>
<p>And at the end of one year, I had 804$ in my account. Using which, I bought a couch and a dining table to my home, which was a long time dream of my mom. That was a moment when I watched my dad helping the truck driver to carry the furniture inside, and my mom are excited.</p>
<p>And that’s when I had this <u>epiphany</u> Damn I grew up :)</p>

<p><strong>你在哪一刻突然感觉自己长大了？</strong></p>
<p>我的第一份工作是学校老师，工资待遇是每月67美元。我在那里工作了一年，令我自己都感到惊讶的是我把自己的工资全部都存了起来。不是一个月的，而是整整一年的。无一例外，每一分钱都存了下来，整整一年的时间里我压制住了自己买任何东西的冲动。</p>
<p>那一年结束时我的账户里有804美元。用这些钱我给家里买了一张沙发和一张餐桌，这是我妈妈长久以来的梦想。那一刻，我看着爸爸帮着卡车司机把家具搬进屋里，妈妈都很兴奋。</p>
<p>这时我才顿悟，我真的长大了：)</p>

<p>Two months ago, I asked a bunch of class 10th kids in a Trivandrum school: “Why do we have to study <u>Quadratic</u>(二次的) equations and all this Maths you are going through? <strong>Your parents also studied these things, but are they using it?</strong>”</p>
<p>You must have seen the delight in the students’ eyes that someone finally asked this question!</p>
<p>Some of them said, “Yes sir, we also wonder why all it is needed. But it is in the <u>syllabus</u>(教学大纲) - so we have to study.”</p>

<p>Here is what I told them.</p>
<p>&quot;When you go to a gym, you lift weights or do <u>biceps curls</u>(二头肌蜷曲), <u>bench press</u>(卧推), or things like that. Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a biceps curl like movement to lift something?</p>
<p>The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and <u>stamina</u> so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns.</strong></p>
<p>By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape(大猩猩) would do.&quot;</p>
<p>That, <u>in a nutshell</u>, is my answer to this question.</p>
<p>I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not <u>compliant</u> robots.</p>

<p><strong>我们为什么要学习？</strong></p>
<p>两个月前，我在特里凡得琅的一所学校里问了一群10年级的孩子， “为什么我们要学习二次方程和你们正在学习的所有这些数学知识? 你们的父母也学过这些东西，但他们现在用得着这些东西吗？”</p>
<p>学生们眼中满是喜悦，终于有人提出这个问题了！</p>
<p>他们有的说：“是的先生，我们也很奇怪为什么要学这些东西。但这些都在教学大纲中，所以我们必须得学习。”</p>
<p>如下是我告诉他们的：</p>
<p>&quot;当你去健身房的时候，你会举重或做肱二头肌卷曲、卧推或类似的事情。你为什么要这样做呢？在现实生活中，你有多少次要做肱二头肌卷曲这样的动作才能举起东西？</p>
<p>我们做这些运动的原因是为了增强我们的力量和耐力，以便我们能够应对任何需要体力的情况。更重要的是，它能提高我们的整体的健康水平和生活质量。</p>
<p>同样，我们学习数学或任何其他科目的原因是它们有助于锻炼我们的逻辑思维，并帮助我们通过识认识事物的运行模式来理解这个世界。</p>
<p>通过学习，我们能够建立世界的模型，这样我们就能比猴子或大猩猩更聪明地应对出现在生活里的各种情况。&quot;</p>
<p>简而言之，以上就是我对这个问题的回答。</p>
<p>我还希望我们能鼓励孩子们提出更多的这类问题，让他们参与更有意义的讨论中来，以便我们能培养出有思想的学生，而不是言听计从的机器人。</p>

<li>Just talking with your friends about your crush or your friend’s one is a waste of time.</li>
<li>Excessively worrying about the future is a waste of time.</li>
<li><strong>Advising People is a waste of time.</strong> None is going to follow your advise ,people do what they want to do.</li>
<li>Staring at girls is a waste of time.</li>
<li>To see WhatsApp status updated of others is a waste of time. It’s always better to mute them.</li>

<p>I agree with all except for the 1st one. Love is the only thing in life that is definitively NOT a waste of time. <strong>Young love can last. Love is the one thing you should put all your energy into, or most.</strong> I’m talking self love, family love, couple love, stranger love. It is the foundation of Human nature.</p>
<p>It’s the <u>misconception</u> that it’s a waste time that makes it <u>fleeting</u> for most. If you know the true meaning of love then you know it is of the utmost important.</p>

<p><strong>In some cases maturity not comes with age. It comes with incident.</strong> Maturity is core element for successful love. Here I am talking about mental maturity.</p>

<li>只是和朋友谈论你的或者他迷恋的对象（却什么也不做）是浪费时间。</li>
<li>过分担心未来是浪费时间。</li>
<li>给别人提建议是浪费时间。没有人会听从你的建议，人们只做他们想做的事。</li>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tulip Brady：</em></p>
<p>除了第一条，其他的我都同意。爱情是人生中唯一绝对不会浪费时间的事情，年轻时候的爱情是可以长久的。爱情是你应该投入所有精力的一件事，或者说是最重要的一件事。我说的是自爱，对家庭的爱，夫妻之间的爱，对陌生人的爱。它是人性的基础。对大多数人来说，正是因为误以为它是在浪费时间，所以它才会昙花一现。如果你知道爱的真谛，那么你就知道它才生命中是最重要的。</p>

<p>在某些情况下，成熟不是看年龄而是看你经历过多少事情。成熟是成功爱情的核心要素，这里我说的是心理上的成熟。</p>

<p>Some intelligent minds have quoted tons of valuable information under this question. Therefore, I would like to go the different way.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of people will not succeed in life?</strong></p>
<p>Well, as an answer to this question, I would say:</p>
<img src="https://gitee.com/zjloved/blogimg/raw/master/img/20220127222846.png" style="zoom:80%;" />
<p>Once there was an old <u>blacksmith</u> who was famous for making the best swords in the country.</p>
<p>The soldiers came to him from different cities, even from distant borders and he made magnificent weapons for all of them.</p>
<p>And the buyers, then <u>boasted</u> of their military achievements - everyone was returning from <u>campaigns</u> with success.</p>
<p>One day a young guy came to him and said:</p>
<p>- Master, please, make the best sword in the world, I want to go on campaign with King. Can you make it?</p>
<p>- Sure, I can but it will take 1 year to make it</p>
<p>- 1 year is too long</p>
<p>- But you have to wait, otherwise, it won’t be the best sword in the world.</p>
<p>The young guy agreed to come after a year.</p>
<p>The blacksmith said, “Meanwhile, you must learn war skills from a <u>reputed</u> master”.</p>
<p>The young man returned after a year. Blacksmith handed him his sword.</p>
<p>During the war, this man showed high war skills and conquered all of his targets.</p>
<p>After sometime, he returned to the blacksmith to say thanks for the best sword.</p>
<p>Blacksmith said,</p>
<p>“<strong>It’s not the sword that won the battles. It’s your fighting skills.</strong> You could do this with any other sword as well. I made this sword in just 2 days but I wanted you to learn extraordinary war skills, that’s why I told you to come after a year”</p>
<p><strong>What kind of people will not succeed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The one who doesn’t know, what he/she needs for success.</li>
<li>The one, who, instead of learning the required skills, focuses on proving his/her (fake) success to others, probably won’t succeed.</li>
<li>The one, who, continuously thinks, if I were handsome or if I were tall or if I were born in White-house or if my father were a businessman, then I would have, for sure, been a badass successful person on this planet, Probably, won’t succeed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If one spends sufficient time in learning, and never gives up, whatever, the conditions will be, I bet, no one can stop him/her from becoming successful.</strong></p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>什么样的人不会成功？</strong></p>
<p>我想讲个故事作为这个问题的答案：</p>
<p>从前有一个老铁匠，他以制造全国最好的剑而闻名于世，士兵们从不同的城市，甚至从遥远的边境来找他，他都为他们制作了锋利的武器。而买主们，逢人都会夸耀自己的军功，因为他们每个人都是身负战功归来。</p>
<p>有一天，一个年轻人来找他，说：</p>
<p>-大师，请你做一把世界上最好的剑，我想和国王一起出征，你能做出来吗？</p>
<p>-当然可以，不过要花一年的时间来做。</p>
<p>-1年太久了。</p>
<p>-但你一定得等，否则，就不是世上最好的剑了。</p>
<p>小伙子答应一年后再来。</p>
<p>铁匠说：“在这期间，你必须向一位有名望的师傅学习战术。”</p>
<p>年轻人一年后回到铁匠这里，铁匠把剑交给他。在接下来的许多场战争中，这个人表现出很高的战术，打败了他所有的敌人。过了一段时间，他回到铁匠那里，感谢铁匠给了他一把世上最好的剑。</p>
<p>铁匠说：“帮你赢得战斗的不是这把剑，而是你的战术，你用别的剑照样可以做到这一点。这把剑我只用了两天时间就打造出来了，但我想让你学会非凡的战术，所以我才告诉你让你一年后再来取剑。”</p>
<p><strong>什么样的人不会成功？</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>一个不知道为了成功需要什么的人不会成功；</li>
<li>一个只想证明Ta那伪成功给别人而不去学习真正技术的人可能不会成功；</li>
<li>一个不断地假想如果我很帅、如果我很高、如果我出生在白宫或者如果我爸是个商人的话那么我一定会成为这地球上非常成功的人，这种人可能不会成功。</li>
</ul>
<p>如果一个人花足够的时间去学习，并且永不放弃，无论什么情况下，我敢打赌，没有人能阻止他的成功。</p>
<p>祝你成功！</p>

<p>During a robbery in America, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: “Don’t move. The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called “<strong>Mind Changing Concept</strong>”. Changing the conventional way of thinking.</p>
<p>When a lady lay on the table <u>provocatively</u>, the robber shouted at her: “Please be <u>civilized</u>! This is a robbery and not a rape!”</p>
<p>This is called “<strong>Being Professional</strong>”, Focus only on what you are trained to do!</p>
<p>When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): “Big brother, let’s count how much we got.”</p>
<p>The older robber rebutted and said: “You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!”</p>
<p>This is called “<strong>Experience</strong>”, Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications!</p>
<p>After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: “Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously <u>embezzled</u> from the bank”.</p>
<p>This is called “<strong>Swim with the tide</strong>”, Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage!</p>
<p>The supervisor says: “It will be good if there is a robbery every month.”</p>
<p>This is called “<strong>Killing Boredom</strong>”, Personal Happiness is more important than your job.</p>
<p>The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: “We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a <u>snap</u> of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!”</p>
<p>This is called “<strong>Knowledge is worth as much as gold!</strong>”</p>
<p>The bank manager was smiling and happy because his losses in the <u>share</u> market are now covered by this robbery.</p>
<p>This is called “<strong>Seizing the opportunity</strong>” <u>Daring</u> to take risks!</p>
<p>So who are the real robbers here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>这就是所谓的 “专业”，所以你应该只专注于自己所受培训的那件事儿上！</p>

<p>银行劫匪回家后，受过MBA培训的小劫匪对只读完小学六年级的大劫匪说：&quot;大哥，我们来数数有多少钱。&quot;大一点的劫匪反驳说：“你真笨，这么多钱，我们要花很长时间才能数清楚，今天晚上电视新闻会告诉咱们，咱俩到底从银行抢了多少钱！”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这就是所谓的 “经验”，现在这社会，经验比纸面上的学历更重要！</p>
</blockquote>
<p>劫匪走后，银行经理让银行主管赶快报警，但主管对他说：“等一下，我们从银行里拿出一千万来，自己用，再加上我们之前贪污的七千万”。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这就是所谓的 &quot;顺应潮流 &quot;，你得将不利的局面转化成对自己有利的局面！</p>
</blockquote>
<p>主管说：“要是每个月都有抢劫案，那就好了”。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这叫 &quot;解闷儿 &quot;，个人的幸福感要比工作更重要。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>第二天，电视新闻报道说，银行里有一亿美元被抢走了。劫匪们数啊数，数啊数，却只数到了2000万美元。劫匪们非常生气，抱怨道：“我们冒着生命危险，只拿了两千万美元，银行经理弹指一挥间就拿走了8000万美元。看来，做贼不如多接受教育！”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这就叫 “知识就是金钱！”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>银行经理笑得合不拢嘴，因为他在股市上的损失，现在已经被这次抢劫案给覆盖了。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这就叫 “抓住机会”，敢于冒险!</p>

<p>那么，这里谁才是这个故事里真正的强盗呢？！</p>

<p><strong>You should not be sitting at home during semester breaks.</strong> Teen period is the best time for you to do something good with your life. Every hour you waste in that time <u>is equivalent to</u> wasting 10 hours in a later time period.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I spent my 2nd semester break in one of Chennai’s largest libraries learning Java. I was also reading books like “How to get whatever you want” to improve my business skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My 3rd semester break was spent in working with a professor on a project involved <u>Neural</u> Networks and <u>Genetic</u> Algorithms. I also did a lot of coding with algorithms from <u>CLRS</u>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4th semester break I spent in preparing for GRE [I had to write it early as people scared me about the new pattern that was coming that year]. <u>Getting that monkey off my back</u> early allowed me to <u>fret</u> less about what I will do after college.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5th semester break went in preparing for ACM ICPC programming contest and going to Asia regionals in Dhaka.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6th semester break went into working in a research project for which got IEEE student paper award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7th semester break was into working on a project that got me an entry into HP’s Asian young inventors awards in Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8th semester break was spent working as Summer Research Fellow at IISc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is a lot of <u>bragging</u>. Just to convince you how important is college life. There was not a single semester break I spent either at home or in travel. There were a lot of successful people I know who pretended as though they achieved without doing anything. I know how hard they worked and also how hard they worked to avoid you knowing how hard they worked.</p>
<p>And that hardwork really <u>paid off</u> that time. There was a time during college when a tech company invited me to be their Chief guest for their new office <u>inauguration</u> and I was much younger to all the people applying for a job there — originally the folks there cleared me off to the <u>jobseeker</u> queue until they realised I was the one inaugurating the program.</p>
<p>After graduation and joining work at my dream company, I spent a lot of time <u>binge</u> watching Netflix. That <u>paid off</u> too — as my career slowed down and hit a wall. My life’s <u>momentum</u> dropped to zero. I had to once again bring the momentum back.</p>
<p>Every hour you spend at home or with TV during your younger years will come to bite you. Take up an internship to learn and contribute to the company. Their leaders will notice the new star. Or take up volunteering with a cause you most associate with and move the world a little closer to where you want it. Or take up a skill you could really master. Or work in a lab and really help your guide or other researchers to make their task easy [say collecting data, setting up experiments etc]. And read lots of books.</p>
<p>You could still ignore all this and sit infront of Netflix or watch the World Cup. That could help you lot <u>recounting</u> stories of regret to your children and grandchildren. The reason why your teachers and parents stress so much on this is because they know how painful it is to screw up their time and endup like that.</p>
<p>Get up and get out.</p>

<li><strong>Observe their spending habits.</strong> Do they spend money to collect moments or things? People that spend money on things would always buy stuff that they do not need, they are money wasters, <u>stingy</u> and not <u>adventurous</u>!</li>
<li><strong>Observe the way they treat common people out there</strong>, e.g. Beggars, homeless people, waitress, cleaners etc. You can use this to measure their level of <u>sympathy</u> and <u>empathy</u>.</li>
<li><strong>How do they talk about other people</strong>, do they mock, belittle and gossip about them? Such people cannot be trusted!</li>

<li><strong>Golden spending rule</strong>: If you can’t afford two of it, you can’t afford it.</li>
<li>When you’re thinking about buying something you don’t necessarily need, imagine the item in one hand and the cash in the other. Which one would you take?</li>
<li>Never loan a friend more than you can afford to <u>give away</u>.</li>
<li>If a job makes you pay money to work for them, it’s a <u>scam</u>.</li>
<li><strong>Want to find a good job after college? Make friends with as many people in your field that are on track to graduate one or two years ahead of you.</strong></li>
<li>Take a picture of business cards people hand you, just in case you lose them.</li>
<li><strong>Secretaries, tech support, and janitors are the true power in an office. Make friends with them and you’ll be able to get anything you need!</strong></li>
<li>If you forget someone’s name simply say, “Sorry, what was your name again?” They may look annoyed, but once they tell you their first name say, “No, I meant your last name.”</li>
<li>The next time you <u>stub</u> your toe or get a cut, look away. The body <u>oftentimes</u> associates pain with sight.</li>
<li>If you ever have to park in a city at night, park in front of a bank. They’re lit up and have cameras everywhere.</li>
<li>Tie a small piece of brightly colored fabric to your luggage. You’ll be able to spot your bag at the airport in no time!</li>
<li>Hang a picture of a tattoo you want somewhere you’ll see it every day for a year. If you still want it after that, then it’s worth getting.</li>
<li>Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success.</li>
<li>If you are buying headphones or speakers, test them out with “<u>Bohemian Rhapsody</u>”. It has the complete set of highs and lows in instruments and <u>vocals</u>.</li>
<li>Never be afraid to spend a little extra on a new bed and shoes. If you’re not in one, you’re in the other.</li>
<li>When you feel like you need something, but you can’t figure out what it is, it’s water. It’s always water.</li>
<li>Always <u>under-promise and over-deliver</u>. Most people tend to do the opposite.</li>

<p>We know each other for 12 years and happily married for 10yrs.</p>
<ol>
<li>First thing in the morning when we wake up we kiss and hug each other, it’s like a bed coffee, continuing for 10yrs.</li>
<li>It’s a daily routine. We both call each other in the morning to check whether we have reached our respective offices.</li>
<li>Call in lunch-time to find out whether we had our lunch; not a single day missed without calling.</li>
<li>She always cooks and I always clean, we never complained about this to each other.</li>
<li>Wake up early on Weekends compared to weekdays, this will give a lot of time for both of us to spend together. Typically weekend starts with a long walk or long drive together.</li>
<li>What may come, we ensure that we never leave each other and be alone for more than 2 weeks. We were lucky enough to follow this for last 10yrs.</li>
<li>Friday night for sure we will watch one classic old <u>Tamil</u> movie together on TV. Always it would be a happy ending movie, so we go to sleep light-hearted and wake up the next day early with lots of positive energy.</li>
<li>We respect our personal spaces and when one needs this space, we don’t interfere.</li>
<li><strong>Our mobile phone password is known to each other and can even exchange our phones for the entire day. There is nothing called secrets.</strong></li>
<li>She is a Tea lover, I make fantastic tea to make her happy. I am a coffee lover and she is a <u>fabulous</u> coffee maker to make me happy. So we live by the quote “The greatest happiness in the world is to make others happy.”</li>
</ol>
<p>These are everyday habits and these things develop over time automatically.</p>
<p>Just remember one thing: you have to make your partner a priority, put some effort into it, love partner for what they are and watch the magic <u>unfold</u>.</p>

<p>I am sharing the list of Most Powerful Life tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you don’t want to check your bank account because you are afraid, you should definitely check your bank account.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t fill “To” field in email until you are completely done with the content of email.</strong></li>
<li>The <u>period key</u> and <u>comma key</u> move YouTube videos one frame forward and backward respectively.</li>
<li>Be <u>objective</u> instead of being <u>subjective</u>. e.g. if someone send you an email with no attachment then say “attachment is missing in the email” instead of “you did not send attachment along with email”.</li>
<li>Always check the air pressure in your spare tire and learn how to use it before going to long trip.</li>
<li>If you are nervous about public speaking, go first, and do it.</li>
<li>If it takes less than 15 minutes to do then do it now instead of procrastinating it for later.</li>
<li>If you are getting in a large park with your kids, take a picture of your kids, so in case you lost them at park you can show how they look like and what they’re wearing.</li>
<li>Use the “it was my understanding” with any idea or thought when talking professionally.</li>
<li><strong>If your printer ran out of black ink, then change the color of font to #010101, which is 99% grey and it will work fine.</strong></li>
<li>If someone is not shutting up and won’t let you talk, drop something, person will pause when you go down to pick it up. Use that as an opportunity to say your point.</li>
<li>Before doing anything, think “would an idiot do that?” and now you got your answer.</li>
<li>always remember X% of Y is equal to the Y% of X.</li>
<li>Always check the reader first of the gas pump machine before entering your card in it.</li>
<li>In setting put on the “undo” option for email so you have 30 seconds time to unsend the email, you wrongly sent.</li>
<li>Apologize less and say thank you more e.g. say “thank you for listening” instead of saying “I’m sorry i talk too much”.</li>
<li><strong>I never break the hug first with the person I love or getting interested.</strong></li>
<li>If you hate splashing because of poop drop on water, put toilet paper on the top of water in commode.</li>
<li>If someone ask “why are you so quiet?” answer them with “Why, are you nervous?”</li>
<li>Always remember “NO” is a complete sentence.</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes you type something with all CAPS on and you don’t want to rewrite it all. Just select all the text and press Shift + F3</strong></li>
<li>All government universities offer a student email ID, use that to get free Microsoft Windows instead of paying.</li>
